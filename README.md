SwingSet2
=========
Original application SwingSet2 - code works perfectly.

if you want to play with code and try out your changes, go ahead

1) clone entire repository  

2) to run SwingSet2 as an application - compile "SwingSet2.java"

3) to run SwingSet2 as an applet - compile "SwingSet2Applet.java"

also I attached runnable JAR file - SwingSet2.jar

You can try out and unpack jar file.

Compiled it 24-05-2014 - guarantee that the code works.  

Have fun.
